# Python + Kaggle and Final General Workshop
Thank you all for joining us for our Web Development Workshop on Tuesday, May 3rd, 2022. For anyone who missed the meeting, we talked about the basics of HTML/CSS and Javascript whilst doing a coding demo, creating a guessing game. This game consisted of a user guessing a number from 1 - 100. Below are additional details on using the folders "Starter Code" and "Full Code" to see some of the code that we went over and wrote. 

We hope that you all learned a few valuable skills Below you will find the Zoom recording, and for additional resources on web development, checkout out our presentation slides. Below is information on our next workshop, too.

### Starter and Full Code Folders
#### Starter Code
This folder contains all the starter code that we sent out to all members during the meeting. Inside the folder you'll see the CSV file that we used during the worksho. Inside the CSV is the data from all laptops/computers available, from Mac to Microsoft. Feel free to look over the file to see the other information included inside. Here is a quick skim of the content inside.
