# Python + Kaggle and Final General Workshop
Thank you all for joining us for our **Python Workshop/Final General Meeting on Tuesday, May 3rd, 2022**. For anyone who missed the meeting, we talked about the basics of using Kaggle with Python, followed by us summing up our Spring Semester and saying farwells to all seniors (Execs + members). For anyone wondering, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges. Specifically, for our workshop, we did a demo on manipulating the data from the CSV file, that contains certain specs about laptops, with Python. The code was relatively easy to follow, so it won't be difficult if you'd like to look at the folders in this repository.

We hope that you all learned a few valuable skills. Below you will find presentation slides that we used, which contains additional resources on Python/how it relates to Data Science. Since this was our last workshop of the semester, we wish you all the best of luck on finals and if you're graduating, good luks on your endeavors. See you all for the Fall 2022 Semester, in which we plan on having plenty of more exciting events.

### Starter and Full Code Folders
#### Starter Code
This folder contains all the starter code that we sent out to all members during the meeting. Inside the folder you'll see the CSV file that we used during the workshop. Inside the CSV is the data from all laptops available, from Mac to Microsoft. Feel free to look over the file to see the other information included inside. Here is a quick skim of the content inside:

#### Full Code
This folder contains the Computers CSV file and the completed Python code that we used to get certain data from the CSV file.
